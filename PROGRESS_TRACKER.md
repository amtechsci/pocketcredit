#### Step 4 - Dynamic, Multi-Step Profile Management ✅ (Completed: 2025-01-27)
1. **Database Schema Update** ✅
   - Added profile_completion_step column to users table
   - Created migration script for database update
   - Set initial step to 2 for new users (after OTP verification)

2. **User Model Enhancement** ✅
   - Updated createUser function to set initial profile_completion_step
   - Added updateProfileById function for flexible profile updates
   - Enhanced getProfileSummary to include profile_completion_step
   - Added profile completion tracking

3. **User Controller** ✅
   - Created `src/server/controllers/userController.js`
   - Implemented updateBasicProfile for Step 2 (basic details)
   - Implemented updateAdditionalProfile for Step 3 (additional details)
   - Added getProfileStatus for progress tracking
   - Comprehensive Joi validation for all profile fields

4. **User Routes** ✅
   - Created `src/server/routes/userRoutes.js`
   - Defined PUT /api/user/profile/basic endpoint
   - Defined PUT /api/user/profile/additional endpoint
   - Added GET /api/user/profile/status endpoint
   - Integrated requireAuth middleware for all routes

5. **Server Integration** ✅
   - Updated `src/server/server.js` to use new user routes
   - Integrated user routes under /api/user prefix
   - Maintained existing route structure

#### Step 5 - Loan Application Management ✅ (Completed: 2025-01-27)
1. **Loan Application Model** ✅
   - Created `src/server/models/loanApplicationModel.js`
   - Implemented createApplication with unique application number generation
   - Added findApplicationsByUserId for user-specific queries
   - Included application statistics and validation functions

2. **Loan Application Controller** ✅
   - Created `src/server/controllers/loanApplicationController.js`
   - Implemented applyForLoan with profile completion validation
   - Added getAllUserLoanApplications for user dashboard
   - Included comprehensive Joi validation for loan data

3. **Profile Validation** ✅
   - Critical prerequisite check: profile_completion_step must be 4
   - 403 Forbidden response for incomplete profiles
   - Pending application check to prevent multiple applications

4. **Loan Application Routes** ✅
   - Created `src/server/routes/loanApplicationRoutes.js`
   - Defined POST /api/loan-applications/apply endpoint
   - Added GET /api/loan-applications for user applications
   - Included individual application and statistics endpoints

5. **Server Integration** ✅
   - Updated `src/server/server.js` to include loan application routes
   - Integrated routes under /api/loan-applications prefix
   - Maintained existing route structure

### Next Steps: Step 6 - Testing & Documentation
1. **API Testing** (Pending)
   - Test all authentication endpoints
   - Test profile management endpoints
   - Test loan application endpoints
   - Validate session management

## Authentication Flow Design
1. **Signup/Login**: User enters mobile number
2. **OTP Verification**: System sends OTP to mobile
3. **Session Creation**: 24-hour session cookie on successful verification
4. **Profile Creation**: New users complete profile after OTP verification

## Database Schema Analysis
- **Users Table**: Primary user data with phone verification flags
- **Employment Details**: User employment information
- **Financial Details**: Income, expenses, credit score
- **Bank Details**: Banking information for disbursements
- **Loan Applications**: Loan request management
- **Transactions**: Payment and EMI tracking
- **Admin Users**: Admin panel access
- **System Settings**: Configurable application settings

## Dependencies Added
- `express`: Web framework
- `mysql2`: MySQL database driver
- `ioredis`: Redis client
- `jsonwebtoken`: JWT token handling
- `cookie-parser`: Cookie parsing middleware
- `dotenv`: Environment variables
- `otp-generator`: OTP generation
- `bcryptjs`: Password hashing
- `joi`: Input validation
- `express-rate-limit`: Rate limiting
- `helmet`: Security headers
- `cors`: Cross-origin resource sharing

## Notes
- Existing code uses JSON file database - migrating to MySQL
- Current auth routes need modification for mobile-first approach
- Redis will be used for temporary OTP storage
- Session management will use secure HTTP-only cookies
