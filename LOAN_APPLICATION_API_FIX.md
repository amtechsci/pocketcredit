# Loan Application API Error Fix

## Problem

**Error:** `POST /api/loans/apply` returned 500 Internal Server Error

**Root Cause:** The frontend was trying to parse the interest rate from a formatted string using regex, which was fragile and error-prone.

### Specific Issue

In `LoanApplicationConfirmation.tsx` line 60:
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Parsing string with regex
interest_percent_per_day: parseFloat(calculation.breakdown.interest_rate.match(/[\d.]+/)?.[0] || '0')
```

The backend was sending:
```javascript
interest_rate: "0.001% per day for 15 days"  // String format
```

The regex parsing was trying to extract `0.001` from the string, but this could fail if:
- The format changes
- The value has more decimal places
- The string is missing

## Solution

### 1. Backend Change (`src/server/routes/loanPlans.js`)

Added raw numeric value to the response:
```javascript
breakdown: {
  principal: loanAmount,
  processing_fee: processingFee,
  processing_fee_percent: processingFeePercent,
  interest: totalInterest,
  interest_rate: `${interestPercentPerDay}% per day for ${totalDays} days`, // Keep for display
  interest_percent_per_day: interestPercentPerDay, // ✅ Add raw numeric value
  total: totalRepayable
}
```

### 2. Frontend Change (`src/components/pages/LoanApplicationConfirmation.tsx`)

Use the raw numeric value directly:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use raw numeric value
interest_percent_per_day: calculation.breakdown.interest_percent_per_day || 0.001
```

### 3. TypeScript Interface Update (`src/components/pages/LoanPlanSelection.tsx`)

Updated interface to include the new field:
```typescript
breakdown: {
  principal: number;
  processing_fee: number;
  processing_fee_percent: number;
  interest: number;
  interest_rate: string;
  interest_percent_per_day: number; // ✅ Added
  total: number;
};
```

## Benefits

✅ **More Reliable:** No regex parsing needed  
✅ **Type Safe:** TypeScript knows the exact type  
✅ **Future Proof:** Won't break if string format changes  
✅ **Cleaner Code:** Direct property access vs. regex extraction  
✅ **Error Prevention:** Fallback value (0.001) if missing  

## Testing

After these changes:
1. Navigate to loan application page
2. Select loan amount and purpose
3. Choose a repayment plan
4. Click "Submit Application"
5. ✅ Application should submit successfully without 500 error

## Files Modified

1. `src/server/routes/loanPlans.js` - Added `interest_percent_per_day` to breakdown
2. `src/components/pages/LoanApplicationConfirmation.tsx` - Use raw value instead of parsing
3. `src/components/pages/LoanPlanSelection.tsx` - Updated TypeScript interface

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Loan applications can now be submitted successfully!
