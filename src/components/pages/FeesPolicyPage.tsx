                i. Key Principles
              </h3>
              <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">
                In compliance with the referred circular and Directions issued by RBI, the key principles based on 
                which the terms and conditions for penal charges have been framed are as follows:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li className="text-sm text-gray-700">
                  The intent of levying penal charges is essentially to inculcate a sense of credit discipline and such 
                  charges are not meant to be used as a revenue enhancement tool over and above the contracted 
                  rate of interest.
                </li>
                <li className="text-sm text-gray-700">
                  Penalty, if charged, for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan contract by the 
                  borrower shall be treated as 'penal charges' and shall not be levied in the form of 'penal interest'.
                </li>
                <li className="text-sm text-gray-700">
                  There shall be no capitalisation of penal charges i.e., no further interest computed on such charges.
                </li>
                <li className="text-sm text-gray-700">
                  No additional component shall be added to the rate of interest.
                </li>
                <li className="text-sm text-gray-700">
                  The quantum of penal charges shall be reasonable and commensurate with the noncompliance of 
                  material terms and conditions of loan contract without being discriminatory within a particular loan / 
                  product category.

                ii. Structure of Penal Charges
              </h3>
              <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Currently, penal charges are only to be levied if repayments are not made by the respective due date 
                and penal charges are not envisaged for any other non-compliances related to other terms and 
                conditions of the loan.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Further, the quantum and reason for penal charges shall be clearly disclosed to the customers in the 
                loan agreement and most important terms & conditions / Key Fact Statement (KFS), in addition to 
                being disclosed on the Company website (pursuant to RBI Guidelines on Digital Lending dated 
                September 02, 2022 and RBI Circular dated April 15, 2024 on Key Fact Statements for Loans and 
                Advances) and the loan agreement. In addition to reminders sent to borrowers for non-compliance 
                of material terms and conditions of loan, the Borrowers shall also be communicated about the 
                applicable penal charges alongwith the instance of levy of penal charges and the reason thereof.
