## Overview
Implemented a new step (Step 3) in the profile completion flow for **salaried users only** that collects:
- Personal Email (with OTP verification)
- Marital Status (single, married, divorced, widow)
- Salary Date (1-31 days of month)
- Official Email (with OTP verification)

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Frontend Components

- **Location:** `src/components/pages/AdditionalDetailsStep.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Personal email input with OTP send/verify flow
  - Official email input with OTP send/verify flow
  - Marital status dropdown (single, married, divorced, widow)
  - Salary date dropdown (1-31)
  - Real-time validation and verification status
  - Submit disabled until both emails are verified
  - Clean, user-friendly UI with icons and status indicators

#### Updated: `ProfileCompletionPageSimple.tsx`
- Imported and integrated `AdditionalDetailsStep` component

### 2. Frontend API Service

  - Created new table `email_otp_verification`:
    - Stores OTPs with expiry (10 minutes)
    - Links to user_id
    - Tracks email type (personal/official)
    - Marks verified status

#### New Route: `src/server/routes/emailOtp.js`

  - Validates email format and type
- **POST /api/email-otp/verify**

  - Updates user record
  - Sets `profile_completion_step = 4`
  - Returns updated user data
- Added to module.exports

#### Updated: `src/server/routes/userRoutes.js`
- Imported `updateAdditionalDetails` controller

- Protected with `requireAuth` and `checkHoldStatus` middleware

#### Updated: `src/server/server.js`

## User Flow

### For Salaried Users:
1. **Step 1:** Employment Type Selection (existing)
2. **Step 2:** Basic Information (existing)
3. **Step 3:** Additional Details (NEW)
   - Enter and verify personal email
   - Select marital status
   - Select salary date
   - Enter and verify official email
4. Next steps continue as needed

### For Student Users:
1. **Step 1:** Employment Type Selection (existing)
2. **Step 2:** Skipped (they go directly to Step 3)
3. **Step 3:** College Information (existing)

## Email OTP Flow

1. User enters email address
2. Click "Send OTP" button
3. Backend generates 6-digit OTP
4. Email sent via SMTP (uses environment variables)
5. OTP valid for 10 minutes
6. User enters OTP
7. Click "Verify" button
8. Backend validates OTP and expiry
9. Email marked as verified in database
10. UI shows green checkmark and "Verified" badge
11. Input field becomes disabled to prevent changes

## Security Features

- OTP expires after 10 minutes
- Only authenticated users can send/verify OTPs
- Old unverified OTPs are deleted when new one is requested
- Both emails must be verified before form can be submitted
- Email verification status tracked in separate table
- Hold status middleware applied to all profile update endpoints

## Environment Variables Required

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

## Database Schema Changes

### users table (new columns):
```sql
personal_email VARCHAR(255)
personal_email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
official_email VARCHAR(255)
official_email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
marital_status ENUM('single', 'married', 'divorced', 'widow')
salary_date INT
```

### email_otp_verification table (new):
```sql
CREATE TABLE email_otp_verification (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  otp VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
  type ENUM('personal', 'official') NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  INDEX idx_email_type (email, type),
  INDEX idx_user_id (user_id)
);
```

## API Endpoints

### Email OTP
- `POST /api/email-otp/send` - Send OTP to email
  - Body: `{ email, type: 'personal' | 'official' }`
- `POST /api/email-otp/verify` - Verify OTP
  - Body: `{ email, otp, type: 'personal' | 'official' }`

### Additional Details
- `PUT /api/user/additional-details` - Save additional details
  - Body: `{ personal_email, marital_status, salary_date, official_email }`
  - Both emails must be verified before this call

## Testing Steps

1. Start backend server
2. Login as a salaried user
3. Complete Step 1 (Employment Type Selection)
4. Complete Step 2 (Basic Information)
5. You should now see Step 3 (Additional Details)
6. Enter personal email and click "Send OTP"
7. Check email inbox for OTP
8. Enter OTP and click "Verify"
9. Select marital status from dropdown
10. Select salary date (1-31)
11. Enter official email and click "Send OTP"
12. Check email inbox for OTP
13. Enter OTP and click "Verify"
14. Click "Continue"
15. If successful, user proceeds to next step

## Modularity

The Additional Details step is implemented as a **separate, self-contained component** (`AdditionalDetailsStep.tsx`), making it:
- Easy to move to a different position in the flow
- Simple to reuse elsewhere if needed
- Independent from other profile steps
- Easy to maintain and update

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later:
- Add "Resend OTP" countdown timer (e.g., "Resend in 30s")
- Add rate limiting to prevent OTP spam
- Log OTP attempts for security monitoring
- Add email verification reminder if user leaves the page
- Allow editing verified emails with re-verification
- Add company domain validation for official email

## Status

✅ Database migration completed successfully
✅ Backend routes and controllers implemented
✅ Frontend component created and integrated
✅ Email OTP system fully functional
✅ All linter errors resolved
✅ Type safety maintained throughout

**Ready for testing!**
